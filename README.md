# WorldSeed
To help develop new .NET applications.

# Main goal:
1# To create a secure, fast, loosely coupled template that can be used as base for any web project.

# Other goals: 
1# To have only one code base to maintain and everything else should be an extension. This way any improvements you make to the framework can be shared between projects, saving time and money.

# The template:
As a developer I dislike reinventing the wheel every time I am assigned to work on a project, I wish to create a template that can be used to quickly create new projects, without having to sacrifice security or the quality of the code.

# Features:
- Clean architecture
- Repository pattern
- Unit Of work pattern
- Service pattern
- JWT bearer token authentication
- REST API
- Cross platform

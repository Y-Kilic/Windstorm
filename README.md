# WorldSeed

# Main goal:
1# To create a secure, fast, loosely coupled framework that can be used as base for any project.

# Other goals: 
1# To have only 1 code base to maintain and everything else will be an extension. This way any improvements you make to the framework can be shared between projects, saving time and money.

# The framework:
I as a developer dislike reinventing the wheel every time I am assigned to work on a project, I wish to create a framework that can be use to quickly create projects, without having to sacrifice security or the quality of the code.
